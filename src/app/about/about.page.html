  <h3><i>...Because Second Edition has huge cards and too many tokens</i></h3>
  <p>
    This app will maintain your card state for The X-Wing Miniatures Game: Second Edition.
    It is designed to maintain items that are off the play area - cards and shield/charge/force tokens.
    This app is not a squadron builder. You can import XWS squadron data from places like
    <a href="https://raithos.github.io">YASB 2.0</a> or Launch Bay Next.
  </p>

    Found a bug or have a suggestion?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Please submit an issue to <a href="https://github.com/jychuah/XwingTabled/issues">the XwingTabled GitHub repo</a>.
    Better yet, if you have a fix or feature, feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests!
  </p>
  <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
  <p>
    This web app caches some data locally, such as card data or your table state.
    This means you will be required to download data on first use or when 
    new data is released. The advantage is that if you navigate away from
    the app in the middle of the game, you don't have to worry about losing
    your game state.
  </p>
  <h3>Artwork and Game Text Use</h3>
  <p>
    This app uses artwork from Fantasy Flight's image CDN, open source card
    and text data from <a href="https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data2">Guido Kessel's Xwing Data 2 project</a>,
    and <a href="https://github.com/geordanr/xwing-miniatures-font">GeordanR's X-Wing Miniatures Font</a>. 
    This app is not distributed with copyright artwork or card data on its own. Data is downloaded and cached
    upon first use. Artwork is hotlinked from Fantasy Flight for web versions of this application,
    and downloaded and cached for mobile versions.
